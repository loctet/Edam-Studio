\begin{document}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
This artifact accompanies the paper on EDAM Studio, 
a toolchain for generating smart contract code from 
EDAM (Extended Data-Aware Machines) specifications. 
The artifact includes the complete source code, a Docker image for easy deployment, 
pre-generated experiment data (generated code, mutations, and mutation testing results), 
and reproduction scripts. 
Reviewers can verify the tool's functionality through the 
GUI, CLI, or API, and reproduce the experimental evaluation 
including code generation, test execution, and mutation testing. 
Results may vary slightly depending on the machine due 
to the non-deterministic nature of symbolic trace generation.
\end{abstract}

% ARTIFACT: please stick to the structure of 7 sections provided below

% ARTIFACT: section on the scope of the artifact (what claims of the paper are intended to be backed by this artifact?)
\begin{scope}
This artifact supports all experimental claims made in the companion paper. 
Specifically, it enables reproduction of:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Code generation from EDAM models}: 
  The tool generates Solidity smart contracts from EDAM 
  specifications for various models 
  (e.g., asset transfer, ERC-20 tokens, AMM, basic provenance tracking).
\item \textbf{Automated test generation}: 
  Symbolic execution-based generation of test cases from EDAM models using 
  random exploration of the finite state space of the model.
\item \textbf{Mutation testing evaluation}: 
  Mutation scores and results obtained using ReSuMo on the generated code, 
  including comparison across different models and configurations.
\item \textbf{Performance metrics}: 
  Code generation time (up to 20 minutes per model depending on test count), 
  test execution time (up to 20 minutes for 10k tests), 
  and mutation testing duration 
  (less than 2 hours for most models; up to several days for the AMM model due to its complexity).
\end{itemize}

The artifact provides both pre-computed results 
(in \texttt{EXPERIMENT\_DATA/}) 
and the means to regenerate them. 
Note that regenerated results may not match the paper exactly 
due to machine-dependent factors and the non-deterministic 
nature of symbolic trace generation.
\end{scope}

% ARTIFACT: section on the contents of the artifact (code, data, etc.)
\begin{content}
The artifact package includes:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{EDAM Studio source code} (type: software; format: Python, TypeScript, OCaml, JavaScript): The complete implementation in \texttt{Studio/}, comprising:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \texttt{API/}: Django backend for code generation.
  \item \texttt{GUI/}: React/Vite frontend for visual model editing.
  \item \texttt{CLI/}: Command-line interface for batch code generation, 
    testing and mutation testing of the generated code.
  \item \texttt{edams-models/}: Predefined EDAM models in the JSON format (TypeScript/TSX) 
    (assettransfer, c20, amm, basicprovenance, etc.), 
    used for code generation and mutation testing.
  \item \texttt{ReSuMo/}: Mutation testing tool for Solidity smart contracts, 
  used to evaluate the robustness of the generated code.
  %\item \texttt{base\_code/}: OCaml templates for symbolic execution and Z3 integration
  \end{itemize}

\item \textbf{Experiment data} (type: data; format: ZIP, XLSX): Located in \texttt{EXPERIMENT\_DATA/}:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \texttt{Generated Code.zip}: Pre-generated Solidity contracts and tests for the paper's models
  \item \texttt{Mutations.zip}: Generated mutations from ReSuMo
  \item \texttt{Excels Mutations Results.zip}: Detailed mutation testing results per operator
  \item \texttt{Mutation result - Recaps.xlsx}: Summary mutation scores and timing data
  \end{itemize}

\item \textbf{Docker configuration} (type: software; format: Dockerfile, docker-compose): 
In \texttt{Docker/} for containerized deployment.

\item \textbf{Documentation}: \texttt{README.md} and 
\texttt{SETUP\_README.md} with installation and usage instructions.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Reusability}: 
%This artifact can be used to model, generate code, and test smart contracts from EDAM models.
The implementation is open-source (GPL-3.0). 
To recompile: follow \texttt{Studio/install.sh} (Linux/macOS) or \texttt{Studio/install.bat} (Windows). 
The EDAM models and benchmarks are public and included in the repository. 
The artifact can be reused to: 
(1) generate smart contracts from custom EDAM models via the GUI or CLI; 
(2) integrate the code generation pipeline into other tools via the API; 
(3) extend the mutation operators in ReSuMo; 
(4) add new EDAM models by implementing the model interface in \texttt{edams-models/edam/types.ts}.
\end{content}

% ARTIFACT: section containing links to sites holding the
% latest version of the code/data, if any
\begin{getting}
  The artifact is available from two sources:

 \noindent \textbf{Docker Hub} (recommended for quick evaluation):
  \begin{lstlisting}
docker pull loctet/edam-studio:latest
docker run -d -p 3000:3000 -p 5000:5000 \
--name edam-studio loctet/edam-studio:latest
  \end{lstlisting}
  %
  Access: GUI at \url{http://localhost:3000}, API at \url{http://localhost:5000}.

  \noindent \textbf{GitHub} (source code and manual setup):
  \url{https://github.com/loctet/Edam-Studio}

  For manual installation, see \texttt{README.md} and \texttt{SETUP\_README.md} in the repository.
  Or generate the Docker image from the source code:
  \begin{lstlisting}
cd Docker
./build-docker.sh
  \end{lstlisting}

  \noindent \textbf{Quick-start (kick-the-tires)}:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Pull and run the Docker image (commands above) or start the frontend and backend services manually.
    \item Open \url{http://127.0.0.1:3000} and verify the GUI loads.
    \item Generate code via CLI:
      \begin{lstlisting}
docker exec -it edam-studio edam-cli cop 4
      \end{lstlisting}
      This will generate the code of figure 3 in the paper.
  \item Check generated output (a ZIP file) in the container: \texttt{/app/Studio/Generated-code/}
  \end{enumerate}
\end{getting}

% ARTIFACT: section specifying the platforms on which the artifact is known to
% work, including requirements beyond the operating system such as large
% amounts of memory or many processor cores
\begin{platforms}
\textbf{OS and resources used by the authors}: 
Linux (Ubuntu 22.04). CPU: 8+ cores recommended. 
Memory: 8GB RAM minimum, 16GB recommended. 
Disk: 10GB free space. 
GPU: not required.

\textbf{Required hardware for evaluation}:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Code generation}: 4GB RAM, 2 CPU cores. 
    Each model takes up to 20 minutes depending on 
    the number of symbolic traces and the number of transitions per trace.
  \item \textbf{Test execution}: 4GB RAM. 
    Up to 20 minutes for 10000 tests using the generated code (using the generated tests).
  \item \textbf{Mutation testing}: 8GB RAM recommended. 
    Most models: less than 2 hours. 
    AMM model: up to several days (scaled-down evaluation possible with fewer traces).
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Scaled-down evaluation}: 
For time-constrained review, 
use \texttt{--number\_symbolic\_traces 50 --number\_transition\_per\_trace 2} 
to reduce generation time. 
Run mutation testing on a single model (e.g., \texttt{assettransfer}) instead of all models.

\textbf{Known compatibility}: 
The Docker image is built for Linux/amd64. 
Windows and macOS users can run via Docker Desktop. 
opam/OCaml may require WSL on Windows for native installation.
